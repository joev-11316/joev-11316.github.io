## What are mental health issues
Mental health is a state of a person's psychological well-being. It has an impact on how we think, feel and act. It also influences how we handle stress and how we communicate with others. When someone has poor mental health, it means that these qualities are negatively affected and the mental health of a person worsens. In some cases of bad mental health, it can be a mental health disorder, this is the case if ongoing symptoms cause frequent stress and affect the ability to function. The symptoms of the different mental health disorders are different from each other. But all of them either influence thoughts, behavior or emotion. Having mental health issues or mental health disorders does not automatically indicate that the well-being of a person is bad. Someone can have mental health problems but still have a good well-being. This can be done through effective treatment to lessen the symptoms or by being in a place that is considered safe and stable. Nurturing relationships can also help. When not treated a mental health disorder can affect life and cause problems in daily life, such as at school, work or in relationships, by as stated earlier having more trouble handling stress and communication, this can make handling situations more difficult. Other examples of how bad mental health affects people are: continuously feeling sad or down, reduction of the ability to concentrate, excessive fears and mood changes, distancing from others, suicidal thoughts and low energy. Sometimes symptoms of mental health disorders or bad mental health  can appear as physical pain such as a stomachache, headache or other unexplainable aches and pains.

## What are the most common mental health disorders

Schizophrenia is characterized by significant changes in behavior. People with schizophrenia may also experience hallucinations and disorganized thinking. Eating disorders are also very common, like anorexia. The symptoms of anorexia are intense fear of gaining weight and severely restricted caloric intake

## Who can be affected by mental health issues

According to the non-profit organization Mind, the groups that are most commonly affected by mental health problems are people of color, (younger) women, and people who identify as LGBTQ+.

## How does it affect younger people
The adolescent stage in a person's life is very important and very formative, that is why good mental health is very important for a teenager. Globally one in seven teenagers has a mental health problem and there isn't enough thought put into this problem and is therefore not treated.
